Hi, I am a [JSPS Overseas Research Fellow](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-ab/) in the [Department of Ecology, Environment, and Geoscience, Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/department-of-ecology-and-environmental-science/). I am broadly interested in how climate change influences biological communities in mountain ecosystems. My research focuses on understanding whether, how, and why species distributions and abundances are changing and how these changes affect species interactions.

<!-- 
I use various techniques for my research, including thermal sensors, camera traps, 
I also use modeling techniques to assess the climate change impacts on species distribution.


Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
